Running:
-------
Run "make" to build and run
Run "make clean" to cleanup

Instructions:
------------
1.  F - toggles between GL_FILL, GL_LINE Polygon Mode
2.  S - toggles between showing splat vertices and actual vertices
3.  I, J, K, L - Move light source up, left, down, right respectively
4.  A , D - Move selected model left and right respectively
5.  UP, DOWN Arrow key - Move selected model up and down respectively
6.  +, - - Increase, Decrease scale of model respectively
7.  0, 1, 2 - Select the model
    (if we add a model A first, then pressing 0 would select that model)
8. ESC - to quit.    

Notable defects:
---------------
We can only add objects whose facetype is 3.

Inputs and Outputs:
------------------
Please see images folder for outputs.
name of image is option1+option2.png, option1 and option2 are expected inputs
and that image is the expected output.

Help:
