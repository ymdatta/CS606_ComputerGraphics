1. How to run:
       There should be a Makefile in the folder. So just run `make` from
       the directory.

2. Expected inputs-outputs:
   (i) Giving '+' and '-', should zoom the calculator correspondinly as output.
   (ii) Pressing on the 'left' mouse button on any key of the calculator
   	should print the corresponding 'key value' on the console.
   (iii) Giving 'left arrow' and 'right arrow', should translate the
   	 calculator left and right correspondingly.
   (iv) Pressing the 'right' mouse button on any key, should create a red
   	overlay box, and rotate it starting(angle) from '-45' to '45' and
	back to '0'
   (v) Pressing the 'right' mouse button and pointing it at other place
       should move the 'key' to the pointed position.

   The program gives the output as expected.
   
3. Notable effects/defects:

   Say, we pick and point a key, the key moves to that position.
   Now, if another key is moved, 'previous key' which was moved
   comes back to actual postion.

   So, we can pick and point only one key at a time.

4. Report folder is placed in .pdf folder.
